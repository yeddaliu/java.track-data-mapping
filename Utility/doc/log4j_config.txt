log4j: where to put properties file?

1. log4j.properties needs to be on the classpath where log4j can find it.

XXX/bin, WEB_INFO/classes, XXX/lib

2. You may also specify the location of the properties by a system property :
java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///path/to/log4j.properties MyApplication

-Dlog4j.configuration=file:///E:/[JavaLib]Utility/log4j.properties
